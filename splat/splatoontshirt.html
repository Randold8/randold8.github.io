        <p>This product is from Splatoon 3. </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">Splatoon 3 is the third entry in the Splatoon series and the sequel to Splatoon 2. Announced during the February 2021 Nintendo Direct, it was released on the Nintendo Switch on 9 September 2022. It sold quickly, and with 10.67 million copies sold, was approximately the eighteenth-best-selling Nintendo Switch title. 
          Following the Team Chaos victory in the Chaos vs. Order Splatfest, Splatoon 3's style is very chaotic, bringing post-apocalyptic, patchwork, and other chaotic elements together with the styles of both previous games. 
          Splatoon 3 expands the Splatoon series on many different fronts, with an extensive story mode, new Salmon Run challenges and rewards, a wider range of customisation with more options (including the additions of Splashtags and the locker room), and the new mode Tableturf Battle. Additionally, Splatoon 3 streamlines many aspects of the previous games. The Battle Lobby has been reworked into a greatly-expanded practice area accessible between matches, Splatfests are overhauled with three teams rather than two and a new Tricolor Turf War mode, and the UI has been made more responsive and informative. Additionally, Splatoon 3 is the first game in the series to be localized into Korean and Chinese.
