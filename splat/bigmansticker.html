        <p>This product is from <strong>Splatoon 3.</strong> </p>
        <p>
          Splatoon 3 is a 2022 third-person shooter video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is the third game in the Splatoon series following Splatoon 2. The game consists of online multiplayer (player versus player and player versus environment) alongside a single-player campaign, all featuring combat based around ink.
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>It was first revealed in a teaser trailer on 17 February 2021 and was subsequently released on 9 September 2022.</li>
              <li>The game received generally favorable reviews, with praise for its additional maps, single player campaign, customization options, and gameplay mechanics, but criticism for its matchmaking and disconnection issues and lack of new content.</li>
              <li>As of 31 March 2023 Splatoon 3 has sold 10.67 million copies worldwide, making it the fastest-selling game in the franchise and one of the best-selling Switch games.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          Players choose to be either an Inkling or Octoling as their player character. Both wield weaponry that uses colored ink as ammunition.
          </p>
          <ol>
              <li>Weapons are diverse in ability and imagery, with most resembling household objects.
                  <ul>
                      <li>For example, Rollers are large paint rollers that can cover large amounts of area in ink but are generally limited to close-range combat.</li>
                      <li>At the same time, Chargers are weapons which resemble a sniper rifle, and have long range for sniping opponents but are less effective at painting the ground.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Splatoon 3 expands upon this by adding new main, sub, and special weapons to the game.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
          Inklings and Octolings have the ability to morph into a squid or octopus form respectively. This form is referred to as the "swim form", and can be used to climb ink-covered walls or swim through ink faster than the humanoid forms can walk.
